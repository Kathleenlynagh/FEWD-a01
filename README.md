## I Design Jewelry

I have always loved jewelry. In the 90's I left my corporate grphic design job to live and study jewelry design in FLorence Itlay. It was here that I really learned my craft. Here are a few of the skills we dveloped while studying in Flornce: 
* chain making 
* soldering 
* wax carving  
* prototype making 
* stone setting 
* design

To this day I still enjoy designing and making jewelry.
